Project:
A script that:
  1. identifies .pdf files with name e-Factura_client_-_...__22-10-2025__PT0010__SmartBill in /Downloads
  2. extracts month from name
  3. copies the doc into an accounting directory in my google drive folder location
  4. deletes the doc from /Downloads

Create GitHub Actions workflow to automate the process of creating script executables for macos, windows, and ubuntu.
  1. Create executable locally with PyInstaller
  2. Create GitHub workflow to automate on push

BONUS: If time allows, extend it to all types of accounting docs
BONUS: Instead of searching for files locally, fetch the invoices from SmartBill https://api.smartbill.ro/#prezentare_generala
BONUS: If time allows, periodically on the 5th of the month, send email to accounting with docs
